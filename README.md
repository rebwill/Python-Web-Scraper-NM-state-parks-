# ABOUT

I was spending a bunch of time checking when New Mexico State Parks would open for camping again, so I decided to automate it :)

This is a little Python web scraper that checks the banner on NM State Parks camping reservations website, which holds current announcements about closures. It is run on a cronjob and alerts me via a Slackbot when the banner changes.
